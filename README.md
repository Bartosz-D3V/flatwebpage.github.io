## Modern Single Web Page 

This project has been done using https://dribbble.com/shots/1314681-Freebie-PSD-Perth-A-Free-Flat-Web-Design as a base. Perth PSD was a huge and great inspiration for me, but I did not want to make 100% one-to-one copy of it so some changes are more than expected.
Images and design **are not** mine - only code is.

**No Bootstrap & jQuery!** - Pure CSS3, HTML5 and JS (ES6). **RWD assured**.

Live demo: https://bartosz-d3v.github.io/flatwebpage.github.io/

## Code Example

I created this website to practise my front-end skills a little bit.
I used the following stack:

1. JavaScript with Gulp
2. HTML5, CSS3
3. Animate.css

## Installation

It is very easy to make it up and running:

1. git clone
2. npm install
3. gulp

... and you"re good to go :)
